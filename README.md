# mail-auth (api.r3ply.com)

This project is used to perform various auth tasks involving email. It is not exposed directly to the internet, but rather it is a service binding that the route handler upstream binds to, and acts as a gateway for. It is built on top of Stalwart Lab's [mail-auth](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-auth) library.
